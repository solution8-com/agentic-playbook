description: A relentless interview to sharpen a plan or design. Use when the user wants to stress-test their thinking, or uses any 'grill' trigger phrase.

Interview the user relentlessly until you reach a shared understanding. Map this as a **design tree**: every decision branches into the decisions that hang off it.

Work the tree **one question at a time**. The **frontier** is every decision whose prerequisites are already settled — the questions you could ask _now_ without guessing at answers you haven't heard yet. From the frontier, ask the single question the most hangs on, give your recommended answer, and wait. Never batch the frontier into one numbered round — one considered answer beats six rushed ones.

Each question should be formatted like so:

```
❓ **Q1** - **<question title>**: <question body, might be multiple paragraphs, including multiple choices>

➡️ <your recommended answer>
```

Each answer reshapes the tree — settled decisions push the frontier outward and unblock questions that depended on them. Recompute the frontier and ask the next question. Number the questions as one running count across the session (Q1, Q2, ...), so any decision can be referred back to by number.

Finding _facts_ is your job, never the user's. When a frontier question needs a fact from the environment (filesystem, tools, etc.), dispatch a sub-agent to find it — don't ask the user for anything you could look up yourself. Don't block on it: a running exploration is an unsettled prerequisite, so only the questions downstream of it wait for the sub-agent to report — carry on with a question that doesn't depend on it. The _decisions_ are the user's — put each to them and wait.

The session is done when the frontier is empty: every branch of the design tree visited, nothing left silently assumed. Do not act on it until the user confirms you have reached a shared understanding.
